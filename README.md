Threadbare bot to demonstrate most likely Discord bot functionality.
- err.log will be made automatically when an error occurs for the first time.
- .env must be populated with your bot's token and the server (guild) that it will be functioning within

The bot has several general use cases coded in for working examples of common functionality.
